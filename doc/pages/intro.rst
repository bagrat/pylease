Pylease works on Python projects that are being managed by `setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_,
i.e. have ``setup.py`` file in their root directory. This is the only requirement to make Pylease get things done.

------------

Pylease is a regular Python package which comes with a command line tool, obviously called ``pylease``. So to start::

    $ pip install pylease
