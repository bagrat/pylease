Pylease Documentation
=====================

If you are working on a fast-changing Python project which needs frequent releases, you might get in trouble by repeating some routine
tasks again and again. These tasks include updating the package version, creating tags in the source repository, uploading to `PyPi
<http://pypi.python.org>`_ or to your own private repository, etc.

To escape this manual mess, Pylease comes eager to help you out by making those processes as simple as possible by requiring as little as
possible.

This documentation includes all the information needed to for you to use Pylease, as well as extend it further.
